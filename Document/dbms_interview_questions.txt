What is cursor in DBMS?
A cursor is a temporary work area created in the system memory when a SQL statement is executed. A cursor contains information on a select statement and the rows of data accessed by it. This temporary work area is used to store the data retrieved from the database, and manipulate this data

Wy We Need Stored Procedures?
When we want to execute SQL query from applications. the sql statements are first compiled and then executed
which is time consuming processs and can impact the performance if query is big enough.
to overcome this problem we write store procedures which are pre-compiled block of code that can be executed by calling the procedures therby increasing the performance of database and your applications
whenever there is need to write same query again and again we can store that query in the form of stored procedure and can call it whenever required.

IN/OUT Parameters
Stored procedures parameters are of two types
when you want to send value to database from your code in parameters brings value to the procedure whereas
OUT parameters are used to send value from database after query execution and calculation

Package:
A package is a group of related procedures and functions, together with the cursors and variables they use, stored together in the database for continued use as a unit. Similar to standalone procedures and functions, packaged procedures and functions can be called explicitly by applications or users
